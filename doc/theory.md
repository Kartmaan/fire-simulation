# Combustion theory

## Combustion
This is an exothermic (heat-releasing) chemical process of oxidation between a fuel and an oxidizer. 
producing :
- Heat
- Light (flame)
- Combustion products (gas, smoke, ash, etc.)

### Exothermic chemical reaction

- To initiate combustion, energy must be supplied to break down the chemical bonds between the fuel and oxidizer molecules. This is the **energy of activation, and can be provided by a flame, a spark, a hot surface, etc.
- This breakdown is an **endothermic** process, i.e. one that absorbs energy from its environment (generally in the form of heat). 
(usually in the form of heat).
- Once the initial bonds have been broken, the atoms rearrange themselves to form new molecules, 
which are **the products of combustion** (e.g. CO2).
- The formation of these new chemical bonds is an **exothermic** process, which releases heat.
- The energy released comes from the stabilization of the system during this rearrangement.
- With combustion, we “invest” a little energy to break the bonds in the first place, but we “recuperate” a lot more energy during the formation of the new bonds. 
energy when the new, more stable bonds are formed. The energy gained is greater than the energy expended, 
and this difference in energy is released in the form of heat and light.

**To summarize** :
- Breaking bonds = Endothermic (absorbs energy)
- Forming bonds = Exothermic (releases energy)
- Combustion is largely Exothermic, as the energy released when bonds are re-formed is much greater than the activation energy. 
than the activation energy.

### Oxidation
- Means that the fuel reacts with an oxidizer, which is the oxygen present in the air.
- Oxidation is a process in which a substance loses electrons. In combustion : 
  - The fuel is oxidized (loses electrons).
  - The oxidizer is reduced (it gains electrons).

## Fire triangle
The fire triangle is a simplified model for understanding the elements required for most combustions and fires.

Dans ces cas, les trois éléments du triangle sont toujours nécessaires pour que la réaction se poursuive :

- **Fuel**: This is the material that burns. It can be wood, paper, gasoline, etc.
- **The oxidizer**: This is usually the oxygen in the air, needed to keep combustion going. 
Air contains about 21% oxygen, and most fires need at least 16% oxygen to burn.
- **Heat**: This is the activation energy needed to start the combustion reaction.

This triangle may involve a **chain reaction**:
- **Propagation**: Once combustion has started, **the heat generated by the initial reaction may be sufficient 
to ignite more fuel** nearby. This creates a chain reaction in which the heat generated by combustion 
continues to ignite more fuel, as long as all three elements of the fire triangle are present. 
present.
- **Extinguishing**: The chain reaction **can be interrupted by removing one of the elements of the triangle** from the fire. 
For example, by depriving the fire of oxygen, eliminating the fuel, or reducing the heat (e.g. by using water to cool the fire). 
using water for cooling).

## The fire tetrahedron
The fire tetrahedron adds **chain reaction as a fourth element**. It recognizes that fire is not just a simple combination of fuels, but also a complex, self-sustaining chemical process.

Once fuel, oxidizer and heat are brought together and combustion begins, a series of chemical reactions take place. These reactions are exothermic (they produce heat) and **release free radicals**.

> **Free radicals**: These are atoms that have a **single electron**, that is, unpaired, in their outer electron shell. A single electron **desperately seeks to bond with another electron** to form a pair, which causes it to **react very quickly with other substances**. This characteristic makes them very **unstable** and extremely **reactive**.

These free radicals then react with the fuel and oxidizer, spreading the combustion and generating even more heat and free radicals. This is a **self-perpetuating cycle**.

**More targeted extinguishing**

In addition to removing the fuel, oxidizer, or heat, it is also **possible to interrupt the chemical chain reaction**, that is, the propagation of these free radicals. This is the principle behind some chemical extinguishing agents, such as dry chemicals, which work by neutralizing the free radicals and breaking the chain reaction.

**Reignition explained**

The tetrahedron helps explain why **a fire can reignite even after the fuel, oxidizer, or heat appears to have been removed**. If the chain reaction has not been completely interrupted and active free radicals remain, the fire can rekindle if conditions become favorable again.
